# Phlatson CMS
## (PHP Flat-file JSON based CMS ;)
This project is pre-alpha. 

I began this project as a learning excercise. I always try to understand the low-level inner workings of popular web development techniques that I use regularly. This project started that way after having used many different CMSs to build websites, I had run into some of the common challenges related to deployment, maintainence and ease of use for clients. After years of using ProcessWire CMS for the bulk of my web development needs and observing a growing trend in the flat-file CMS space, I wanted to see if I could capture the flexible custom templates and fields approach of ProcessWire with the promised ease of maintence and deploymeny associated with flat-file CMSs. At the time this combination was nearly non existent.  I kept coming back to this project and though I have not had the opportunity to bring to completion, I am trying to learn to share my work more regularly and hope that someone may find it interesting or useful in any capacity. 

So here it is.
